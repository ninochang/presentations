- Improve anything except for recover time (since roll back is easy in cloud)
- Use canary deployment gke stragety
- Work on stability first and then speed.
- Run unit test in cloud deploy, if test filed donâ€™t merge prs.
- Cloud deploy do port forward for you

# Improve GPU utilization
- GPU time sharing up to 48 containers [^8]

# What kind of gen AI starts to see in 2023
- Use gen AI go through complex documents.
- Try to make data conversational, increase efficiency.
- Unstructured data, language, text, conversation.
- Audio/video other type of data.

# What's propt engineering and myth in it
- People think should talk like real comunication
but there's tricks you can use for talking to LLM.
- But with time, models gets less sensitive to which word you use.
- Try to provide detail information in question 
let model understand your question easier.
- Provide some example is a good idea for model to learn and response correct answer.

## How prompt engineering affect knowledge worker ?
- Emerge of new tool always affect all people
- Marketer used to use only news papaer, now social media.
- Get it sonner, get benefit sonner.
- It kill jobs but also create new ones.
- Everyone need to learn make use of gen AI

^ Example:
    - Meeting notes
    - Summarize email
    - Digest long document

## User should have good understanding on underlying model to be a better prompt engineer ?

- Need leading how to programming in english. 
- Communication skill is more important.
- Context of application is more important than model, you need to evaludate the context in the end.
- How do we test "programming in english" if we treat it as software.
- Models give "believeable" answer, not necessary "correct" answer.
- Get feetback from user create feedback loop.
- Custom model will starts from some base model not from scratch.

^ Treat model as software, end-to-end test, evaluate result needs working on.
Since it's believeable answer, how you test to be confident to your answer.
